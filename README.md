# CarGame

This is a simple Pygame-based car game. Steer your car left and right to avoid oncoming obstacles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or compatible
- Pygame

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game

Run the main game script:

```bash
python car_game.py
```

A game window will open. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your car.
Collect the green money blocks to earn points and grab yellow equipment boxes
for extra gear. Hitting a red obstacle subtracts money. The current scores are
displayed in the top-right corner. The timer in the top-left corner shows how 
long you have survived. The road has four lanes with sidewalks and simple
buildings on the sides.
